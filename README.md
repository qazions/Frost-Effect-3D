Freeze Shader for Unity - Frost Effect on 3D Characters and Objects
Description
This repository provides a Freeze Shader for Unity 3D that adds a realistic frost or ice effect to any 3D character or object. With customizable freeze intensity, frost texture, and tint controls, this shader can be seamlessly integrated into any Unity project to bring cold or frozen visuals to life.

Designed for ease of use, this shader allows developers to gradually freeze or unfreeze 3D models, giving dynamic visuals to characters, props, environments, and objects. It includes a FrostManager script for straightforward, adjustable frost application using Unity C#.

Key Features
Customizable Frost Effect: Adjust freeze intensity, frost texture, and color tint for a tailored frost appearance.
Freeze & Unfreeze with Smooth Transitions: Implement gradual frost buildup and melting for dynamic gameplay.
FrostManager Script: Easily manage frost application on multiple materials with ready-to-use Freeze() and Unfreeze() methods.
Optimized for Android: Shader targets Shader Model 2.0, making it compatible with most mobile devices.
Ideal for 3D Games: Works on 3D characters, props, environments, and static/dynamic objects in any Unity 3D game project.
Getting Started
Clone the repository and add the Freeze Shader to your Unity project to start using it with your 3D assets. The included FrostManager script provides simple methods to control the frost effect, allowing you to add ice, frost, or frozen effects dynamically during gameplay.
